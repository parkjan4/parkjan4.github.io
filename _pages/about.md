Hi! My name is Jang. I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at the University of Toronto. My advisors are [Timothy Chan](https://chan.mie.utoronto.ca/) and [Vahid Sarhangian](https://sarhangian.mie.utoronto.ca/). Before joining U of T, I completed MSc. in [Business Analytics at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/management-technology-and-entrepreneurship/) (2020) and BASc. in [Engineering Science at U of T](https://discover.engineering.utoronto.ca/programs/engineering-programs/engineering-science/) (2018).

My research focuses on data-driven modeling and control of stochastic dynamical systems with applications to healthcare operations management.
